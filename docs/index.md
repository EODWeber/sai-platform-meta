## Overview

The Secure AI Platform is a modular, production-grade framework designed to demonstrate secure-by-design AI engineering across the full machine-learning lifecycle:

> data â†’ model â†’ API â†’ agent â†’ CI/CD â†’ observability â†’ security

This document is the single source of truth for the programâ€™s architecture, components, toolchain, and development standards.

## Objectives
- Build a portfolio-grade reference platform showing end-to-end secure AI practices.
- Demonstrate technical mastery of MLOps, DevSecOps, and AI security engineering.
- Provide reusable scaffolds, policies, and automation patterns for secure AI delivery.
- Maintain open, self-contained repositories for each functional component.

## Logical Architecture

### Core Flows

| Flow                  | Description                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dev / Train           | Reproducible ML pipelines (PyTorch / Sklearn) â†’ metrics + artifacts logged to MLflow |
| Serve                 | Secure inference API (FastAPI + JWT + RBAC) â†’ models pulled from registry            |
| Agent                 | LangChain service with restricted tool use, Vault-backed secrets, and audit logging  |
| Security & Compliance | CI â†’ SBOM â†’ scan â†’ sign â†’ OPA policy â†’ release                                       |
| Observability         | OpenTelemetry traces/logs/metrics â†’ Loki / Grafana dashboards                        |
| Secrets & Data        | Vault issues short-lived credentials; dataset cards define provenance & use policy   |

### Trust Boundaries
- Public client â†” API/Agent gateways
- Services â†” Model registry / data store
- CI/CD runners â†” Artifact registries
- Vault as single source of secret truth

## Governance & Standards

- Branching: Trunk-based with short feature branches
- Commits: Conventional commits; signed commits optional
- CI/CD:
  1. Lint & test
  2.	Generate SBOM (Syft)
  3.	Scan (Trivy)
  4.	Policy gate (OPA)
  5.	Sign (Cosign)
  6.	Release (tag & publish)
- Security Baseline:
- JWT + RBAC auth
- Vault for secrets
- TLS enforced
- No plaintext secrets or .env files
- CodeQL + Dependabot active
- Definition of Done: CI green, zero unwaived High/Critical, docs updated, runbook present.

## Documentation Model

Each repo contains:

```
/docs/
  tech/          â†’ authoritative specs, threat models, runbooks
  narrative/     â†’ learning notes, articles, retrospectives
```

Program-level docs (like this one) live in sai-platform-meta.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk              | Impact | Mitigation                               |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Time variability  | Medium | Use Kanban WIP limits + small tasks      |
| GPU/driver issues | Medium | Containerized CUDA stack + CPU fallbacks |
| Scope creep       | High   | Explicit non-goals per repo              |
| Secret exposure   | High   | Vault from day 1 + detect-secrets        |
| Tool sprawl       | Medium | Shared Makefile + base images            |

## Success Criteria
- âœ… Every repo passes CI & policy gates
- âœ… 100 % images signed and SBOM-tracked
- âœ… Telemetry active in all services
- âœ… Public deliverable per phase (repo + article + artifact)
- âœ… Security posture measurable (0 High/Critical)
